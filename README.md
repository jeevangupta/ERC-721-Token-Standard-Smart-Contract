# Creating an ERC-721 Token Standard Smart Contract 
    
- This project will help you familiarize yourself with the Ethereum (EVM- Ethereum Virtual Machine) ecosystem by writing, testing, and deploying an ERC-721 Token Standard smart contract on the Polygon Mumbai Testnet in the Solidity programming language. Through this project, you will learn foundational knowledge to begin your journey creating EVM- based Web3 projects that utilize token mechanisms including Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).
